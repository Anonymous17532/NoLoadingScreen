# No loading screens

## Setup

### Download the latest file or build from source
(https://github.com/Anonymous17532/NoLoadingScreen/releases/tag/1)

### Put it in your mods folder along with fabric API (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/download)

### Now, dont get bored on that 10 minute loading screen when you have over 300 mods on like me!
